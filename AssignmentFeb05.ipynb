    "A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as data members, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or methods. The data and methods that are defined in the class are automatically taken when an object is created. The class is a template or blueprint for objects. One can make as many objects as they want to be based on a class.\n",
    "For example, the template for the car is created first after that multiple units or objects of cars can be created based on the template. And each of the objects must have the data and methods mentioned in the blueprint.\n",
    "A class is a set of traits and features that define an object. It is a blueprint which must be implemented by each of its objects.\n",
    "For example: If we define a blueprint of human beings then it can have attributes like Name, Age, Gender, Occupation and functionalities like Walk(), Eat(), and Sleep(). Any human being must have these properties(data) and functionalities(methods) associated with them."
